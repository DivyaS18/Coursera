# Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library

## Description
In the world of finance, a company's stock share represents ownership in that company. A stock (also known as equity) is a security that entitles its owner to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits, based on the number of shares owned. Investors can buy and sell stocks, aiming to profit from price increases, while also facing potential losses from price declines. The complexities of stock pricing depend on various factors, including the number of outstanding shares and the company's projected future profits.
